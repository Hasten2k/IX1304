### Real Numbers and the Real Line
Real numbers can be expressed as decimal values, both positive and negative.

Real numbers can be represented on a number line (the **Real Line**).

The symbol **ℝ** denotes the Real Numbers.

#### Algebraic Properties
Real numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided to produce new real numbers.

#### Order Properties
If _x_ lies to the left of _y_ on the number line, _x < y_ or _y > x_.

#### Rules for Inequalities
If _a_, _b_, and _c_ are real numbers, then:

1. a < b ⟹ a + b < b + c
2. a < b ⟹ a - b < b - c
3. a < b and c > 0 ⟹ ac < bc
4. a < b and c < 0 ⟹ ac > bc; this leads to _-a_ > _-b_
5. a > 0 ⟹ 1/a > 0
6. 0 < a < b ⟹ 1/b < 1/a

#### The Completeness Property
The _Completeness Property_ states that for any set **A** with real numbers in it, if it exists a number _y_ that is larger than any number in **A**, then _y_ is called an **Upper Bound**. If such a _y_ exists, then there exists another number which is smaller than any other in **A**. This smaller number is called a **Least Uppper Bound** or **Supremum** of **A**.

#### Subsets of Real Numbers

1. The **Natural Numbers**. This is the same as the positive integers (1, 2, 3 etc). Note that the **Positive Integers** does not include the number 0.
2. The **Integers**, the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 etc.
3. The **Rational Numbers**. That is, numbers that can be expressed as a fraction _(m/n)_ where _n_ ≠ 0. Rational Numbers can be either **terminating** or **repeating**.
  a. **Terminating** numbers are fractions that end with an infinite string of zeros.
  b. **Repeating** numbers are numbers that end in an infinite string of digits that repeat over and over.

**Real numbers** that are not a part of the **Rational** subset are called **Irrational Numbers**.


The **Rational Numbers** does not possess the _completeness property_. There is for example no rational number whose square is equal to 2.
